/**
    The main chip which generates upto three oscillators of various frequencies in the
    Raduino is the Si5351a. To learn more about Si5351a you can download the datasheet
    from www.silabs.com although, strictly speaking it is not a requirement to understand this code.

    We no longer use the standard SI5351 library because of its huge overhead due to many unused
    features consuming a lot of program space. Instead of depending on an external library we now use
    Jerry Gaffke's, KE7ER, lightweight standalone mimimalist "si5351bx" routines (see further down the
    code). Here are some defines and declarations used by Jerry's routines:

#define BB0(x) ((uint8_t)x)             // Bust int32 into Bytes
#define BB1(x) ((uint8_t)(x>>8))
#define BB2(x) ((uint8_t)(x>>16))

#define SI5351BX_ADDR 0x60              // I2C address of Si5351   (typical)
#define SI5351BX_XTALPF 2               // 1:6pf  2:8pf  3:10pf

// If using 27mhz crystal, set XTAL=27000000, MSA=33.  Then vco=891mhz
#define SI5351BX_XTAL 25000000          // Crystal freq in Hz
#define SI5351BX_MSA  35                // VCOA is at 25mhz*35 = 875mhz
